  "Settings.all-proxy.desc": "Use a proxy server for all protocols. To override a previously defined proxy, use \"\". You also can override this setting and specify a proxy server for a particular protocol using --http-proxy, --https-proxy and --ftp-proxy options. This affects all downloads. The format of PROXY is [http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]. See also ENVIRONMENT section. Note: If user and password are embedded in proxy URI and they are also specified by --{http,https,ftp,all}-proxy-{user,passwd} options, those specified later override prior options. For example, if you specified http-proxy-user=myname, http-proxy-passwd=mypass in aria2.conf and you specified --http-proxy=\"http://proxy\" on the command-line, then you'd get HTTP proxy http://proxy with user myname and password mypass. Another example: if you specified on the command-line --http-proxy=\"http://user:pass@proxy\" --http-proxy-user=\"myname\" --http-proxy-passwd=\"mypass\", then you'd get HTTP proxy http://proxy with user myname and password mypass.One more example: if you specified in command-line --http-proxy-user=\"myname\" --http-proxy-passwd=\"mypass\" --http-proxy=\"http://user:pass@proxy\", then you'd get HTTP proxy http://proxy with user user and password pass.",
